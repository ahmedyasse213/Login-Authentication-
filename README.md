A challenge you can use to help improve your skills is to design a login page that allows users to sign up, sign in, or perform account management tasks. You can take this project further by adding features for email verification, account verification, and resetting the account password.

If you want to build an app or website in the future, this code can be reused. My suggestion for this project is to build API-based authentication using JWT.
